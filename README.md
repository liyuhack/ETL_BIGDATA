# E-commerce Data Pipeline Project 🚀  

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing an e-commerce dataset. The pipeline involves **data extraction**, **cleaning and transformation**, **storage in DuckDB**, and **visualization using Power BI**.  

---

## 🌟 Features  

- **Automated Dataset Extraction**: Downloads datasets directly from Kaggle using the `kagglehub` Python package.  
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans, validates, and prepares data using PySpark.  
- **Efficient Storage**: Utilizes DuckDB for fast querying and lightweight storage.  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizes key e-commerce metrics like sales trends and customer segmentation with Power BI.  

---

## 📂 Workflow Overview  

1. **Extract**: Download dataset from Kaggle.  
2. **Transform**:  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Remove duplicates.  
   - Standardize and encode categories.  
   - Add derived fields (e.g., day of the week).  
3. **Load**: Save cleaned data into a DuckDB database.  
4. **Visualize**: Build interactive dashboards in Power BI by connecting directly to the DuckDB database.

## 📋 Prerequisites  

### 1. Python Libraries  
- KaggleHub  
- PySpark  
- Pandas  
- DuckDB  

### 2. Hadoop Dependency (for PySpark)  
PySpark requires Hadoop dependencies to function properly. Follow the steps below to set it up:  

1. **Download `winutils.exe` for Hadoop**  
   Download from [this repository](https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils). Extract the file and place it in a directory, e.g., `C:\hadoop\bin\winutils.exe`.  

2. **Set Environment Variables**  
   - Add a new system variable:  
     - **Variable name**: `HADOOP_HOME`  
     - **Variable value**: `C:\hadoop` (or the path where you placed `winutils.exe`).  
   - Add `C:\hadoop\bin` to the **Path** system variable.  

3. **Verify Setup**  
   - Open Command Prompt and run:  
     ```  
     echo %HADOOP_HOME%  
     ```  
     You should see `C:\hadoop` (or your chosen path).  
   - Run:  
     ```  
     winutils.exe chmod 777 /tmp  
     ```  
     If no errors occur, the setup is complete.  

4. **Restart Your System**  

For detailed instructions, refer to [Hadoop Setup for PySpark](https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils).

### 3. Power BI Integration with DuckDB  

Power BI supports DuckDB integration, allowing seamless data visualization. Follow this [guide](https://motherduck.com/docs/integrations/bi-tools/powerbi/) to set up Power BI with DuckDB.  

---

## 📊 Insights & Dashboards  

Using Power BI, the following insights were visualized:  

- Sales trends over time.  
- Customer segmentation based on purchase history.  
- Popular product categories and brands.  
- Correlations between day of the week and sales activity.  

The dashboards provide actionable insights for e-commerce businesses.

## 💡 Key Challenges  

1. **PySpark Setup**: Configuring Hadoop for PySpark compatibility was a hurdle. The detailed setup instructions (above) solved this issue.  
2. **Power BI and DuckDB Integration**: Initial challenges in connecting Power BI to DuckDB were resolved using [MotherDuck's documentation](https://motherduck.com/docs/integrations/bi-tools/powerbi/).
